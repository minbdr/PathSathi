                        <li><strong>Language Translators:</strong> Programs that convert programming code into machine language. These processors translate the code written by programmers into machine language so that the computer can execute it correctly.Without language processors, programmers would have to write directly in machine language, which is very difficult and time-consuming. There are three main types of language processors:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Compiler (translates entire program at once)</li>
                                A compiler is a program that translates the entire program written in a high-level programming language into machine language at once. It checks the whole program for errors before creating an executable file. Once compiled, the program can run independently without the compiler.
                                <li>Interpreter (translates line by line)</li>
                                An interpreter translates a program line by line into machine language and executes it immediately. If there is an error in the program, it stops at that line, so programmers can fix errors quickly.

                                An assembler converts assembly language (a low-level language easier for humans to read than machine code) into machine code that the computer can execute directly.

                        <li><strong>Software without Hardware:</strong> Software needs hardware to run on. Without physical components, software has no platform to execute its instructions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Interdependence:</strong> Software provides instructions to hardware, and hardware executes those instructions. For example:
                            <ul>
                                <li>When you type on a keyboard (hardware), the word processing software displays the letters on the monitor (hardware).</li>
                                <li>When you click on a game icon, the CPU (hardware) processes the software instructions to load and run the game.</li>
