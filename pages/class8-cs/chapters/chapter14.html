                    <p>Welcome to the complete guide on Computer Virus and Protection. In this chapter, we will learn about computer viruses, their types, how they spread, their harmful effects, and most importantly, how to protect our computers from these dangerous programs.</p>
                    
                    <h2 style="color: #1e293b; font-size: 1.8rem; font-weight: 600; margin: 2rem 0 1rem 0; padding-bottom: 0.5rem; border-bottom: 3px solid #3b82f6; display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 10px;"><i class="fas fa-virus" style="color: #3b82f6;"></i>What is a Computer Virus?</h2>
                    <p>A computer virus is a type of malicious software (malware) program that is designed to harm or disrupt a computer's normal operation. Just like a biological virus spreads in the human body and makes us sick, a computer virus spreads from one computer to another and causes damage.</p>
                    <p><b><i>A computer virus is a harmful program that can copy itself and spread to other files and computers without the user's permission or knowledge.</i></b></p>
                    <p>The term "virus" was first used by Frederick Cohen in 1983. Computer viruses are created by programmers with bad intentions. These programs can:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Copy themselves and spread to other files</li>
                        <li>Damage or delete important data</li>
                        <li>Slow down computer performance</li>
                        <li>Steal personal information</li>
                        <li>Corrupt system files and make the computer unusable</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 style="color: #1e293b; font-size: 1.8rem; font-weight: 600; margin: 2rem 0 1rem 0; padding-bottom: 0.5rem; border-bottom: 3px solid #10b981; display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 10px;"><i class="fas fa-shield-virus" style="color: #10b981;"></i>Characteristics of Computer Virus</h2>
                    <p>Computer viruses have several distinct features that make them dangerous:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Self-Replication:</strong> 
                        <ul>
                            <li>A virus can make copies of itself automatically.</li>
                            <li>It attaches itself to other programs and files.</li>
                            <li>This is how it spreads quickly throughout the system.</li>
                        </ul></li>
                        <li><strong>Infection:</strong> 
                        <ul>
                            <li>Viruses attach themselves to clean files and programs.</li>
                            <li>When the infected file runs, the virus becomes active.</li>
                            <li>It then spreads to other files in the system.</li>
                        </ul></li>
                        <li><strong>Harmful Nature:</strong> 
                         <ul>
                            <li>Viruses are designed to cause damage to the computer.</li>
                            <li>They can delete files, corrupt data, or crash the system.</li>
                            <li>Some viruses steal sensitive information like passwords.</li>
                        </ul></li>
                        <li><strong>Hidden Operation:</strong> 
                        <ul>
                            <li>Viruses work secretly in the background.</li>
                            <li>Users often don't know their computer is infected.</li>
                            <li>They hide themselves to avoid detection.</li>
                        </ul></li>
                        <li><strong>Activation Trigger:</strong> 
                        <ul>
                            <li>Some viruses activate immediately when a file is opened.</li>
                            <li>Others wait for a specific date or event to activate.</li>
                            <li>For example, some viruses activate on a particular date.</li>
                        </ul></li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 style="color: #1e293b; font-size: 1.8rem; font-weight: 600; margin: 2rem 0 1rem 0; padding-bottom: 0.5rem; border-bottom: 3px solid #8b5cf6; display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 10px;"><i class="fas fa-bug" style="color: #8b5cf6;"></i>Types of Computer Viruses</h2>
                    <p>There are many different types of computer viruses. Each type works in a different way:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Boot Sector Virus:</strong>
                            <p>Boot Sector Virus is the type of virus that infects the boot sector of a hard disk or USB drive. The boot sector is the part of the storage device that loads first when the computer starts. When infected, the virus loads into memory before the operating system, making it very difficult to remove.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Example: Michelangelo virus</li>
                                <li>It spreads through infected bootable USB drives or hard disks</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>File Infector Virus:</strong>
                            <p>The virus that infects and attaches themselves to executable files (files with .exe, .com extensions). When you run the infected program, the virus becomes active and spreads to other executable files on the computer.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Example: CIH virus (Chernobyl virus)</li>
                                <li>It can damage the computer's BIOS and make the computer unbootable</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Macro Virus:</strong>
                            <p>Macro viruses are written in macro languages used in software applications like Microsoft Word or Excel. They infect documents and spread when the infected document is opened. These are very common because many people share documents.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Example: Melissa virus</li>
                                <li>It spreads through email attachments</li>
                                <li>It can send copies of itself to contacts in your email address book</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Multipartite Virus:</strong>
                            <p>This is a complex virus that can infect both the boot sector and program files. It spreads in multiple ways, making it very difficult to detect and remove.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Example: Invader virus</li>
                                <li>It combines features of boot sector and file infector viruses</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Polymorphic Virus:</strong>
                            <p>These viruses can change their code each time they infect a new file. This makes them very difficult to detect because antivirus programs look for known virus patterns. </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>They constantly change their appearance</li>
                                <li>Very difficult for traditional antivirus software to detect</li>
                            </ul>
                            <P><br> <strong>"Polymorphic virus is dangerous". Justify:</strong><br>
                            A polymorphic virus is dangerous because it changes its code whenever it spreads. This makes it hard for antivirus software to detect and remove it. It can remain hidden in the system and damage files or steal data. Therefore, its ability to disguise itself makes it very harmful.</P>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>System Infector Virus</strong>
                            <p>A system infector virus is a type of computer virus that infects important system files or the operating system of a computer. When these files are affected, the computer may not start properly or may work very slowly. It spreads when infected system files are copied to another computer. Because it targets core system files, it can cause serious damage.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Example: Jerusalem virus</li>
                                <li>It can cause the computer to crash on certain dates</li>
                            </ul>
                        <li><strong>Message Carrying Virus:</strong>
                            <p>A message carrying virus is a virus that displays unwanted messages, pictures, or warnings on the computer screen after infecting it. It may not always damage data, but it disturbs the user and shows that the system is infected. These viruses are often created for prank or nuisance purposes. However, they can still reduce system performance.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Example: Melissa virus</li>
                            </ul>
                     </li>
                    <h2 style="color: #1e293b; font-size: 1.8rem; font-weight: 600; margin: 2rem 0 1rem 0; padding-bottom: 0.5rem; border-bottom: 3px solid #f59e0b; display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 10px;"><i class="fas fa-share-alt" style="color: #f59e0b;"></i>How Do Viruses Spread?</h2>
                    <p>Understanding how viruses spread is important to protect your computer. Here are the common ways viruses spread:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Email Attachments:</strong>
                            <p>One of the most common ways viruses spread is through email attachments. Hackers send emails with infected files attached. When users open these attachments, the virus gets activated.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Never open attachments from unknown senders</li>
                                <li>Be careful even with emails from known contacts if they look suspicious</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Infected Websites:</strong>
                            <p>Some websites are designed to download viruses automatically when you visit them. These are often disguised as free software download sites or adult content sites.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Avoid visiting suspicious websites</li>
                                <li>Don't click on pop-up advertisements</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>USB Drives and External Storage:</strong>
                            <p>When you insert an infected USB drive or external hard disk into your computer, viruses can spread automatically. This is especially common in shared computers.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Scan USB drives before opening files</li>
                                <li>Disable AutoRun feature in Windows</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Pirated Software:</strong>
                            <p>Downloaded software from unauthorized sources often contains viruses. People who use cracked or pirated software are at high risk.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Always download software from official websites</li>
                                <li>Avoid using cracked or pirated programs</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Network Sharing:</strong>
                            <p>In networks where files and folders are shared, viruses can spread from one computer to another very quickly.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Use proper network security</li>
                                <li>Protect shared folders with passwords</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Social Media Links:</strong>
                            <p>Hackers often post malicious links on social media platforms. Clicking on these links can download viruses or redirect to infected websites.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Don't click on suspicious links on Facebook, Instagram, etc.</li>
                                <li>Verify before clicking on shortened URLs</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
