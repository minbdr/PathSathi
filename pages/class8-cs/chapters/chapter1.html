In this chapter, we will introduce you to the concepts of Computer, Components, characteristics, Limitations and Application of computer.</p>
                    
                    <h2 style="color: #1e293b; font-size: 1.8rem; font-weight: 600; margin: 2rem 0 1rem 0; padding-bottom: 0.5rem; border-bottom: 3px solid #3b82f6; display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 10px;"><i class="fas fa-question-circle" style="color: #3b82f6;"></i>What is a Computer?</h2>
                    <p>Computer (Commonly Operated Machine Particulary Used for Technology Education and Research ) The word 'Computer' is derived from the Latin word <b>"Computare"</b> means <b>"to Calculate"</b>. Early Computers were primarily used for mathematical calculations. <br> <i><b>Computer is an electronic machine that processes data and performs tasks according to a set of instructions.</b></i> It can store, retrieve and process infomration quickly and accurately. Computers are widely used in various fields like education, business, communication, science, and entertainment. They consists of hardware (Physical parts) and software (Programs).Common types of computers include desktops, laptops, tablets and smartphones. <br>Therefore, A computer is an electronic device that accepts data as input, processes it according to given instructions, and produces meaningful output. It can store and retrieve data for future use.</p>
                    <h4 style="color: #1e293b; font-size: 1.6rem; font-weight: 600; margin: 2rem 0 1rem 0; padding-bottom: 0.5rem; border-bottom: 3px solid #3b82f6;">Basic Computer Terms</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Data:</strong> Data means raw facts and figures that have no meaning on their own. It can be in the form of numbers, letters, or symbols. The computer collects this data before turning it into useful information. For example, just writing "50" or "Red" is data.</li>
                        <li><strong>Information:</strong> Information is processed data that is meaningful and useful. For example, "50" could be information if it represents the number of students in a class.</li>
                        <li><strong>Program:</strong> A program is a set of instructions that tells the computer what to do. It is written using special computer languages. Without a program, a computer doesn’t know how to work. Examples include games, apps, and tools like the calculator.</li>
                        <li><strong>Hardware:</strong> Hardware is the physical part of the computer that we can touch. It includes things like the monitor, keyboard, mouse, and CPU. All these parts work together to help the computer function. Without hardware, the computer cannot run any software.</li>
                        <li><strong>Software:</strong> Software is a set of programs that tell the hardware what to do. In others words, The set of programs that instructs a computer to perform certain tasks is called software. It cannot be touched but is very important for a computer to work. Without software, the hardware is just an empty machine. Examples are MS Word, Chrome browser, or a drawing app.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2 style="color: #1e293b; font-size: 1.8rem; font-weight: 600; margin: 2rem 0 1rem 0; padding-bottom: 0.5rem; border-bottom: 3px solid #10b981; display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 10px;"><i class="fas fa-star" style="color: #10b981;"></i>Characteristics of Computer</h2>
                    <p>Computers are powerful tools that enhance productivity and efficiency in various tasks. They streamline processes by automating repetitive operations and handling multiple functions at once, making them indispensable in modern work and daily life. <br><b><i>The characteristics of the computer system are as follows:-</i></b> </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Speed (गति):</strong> 
                        <ul>
                            <li>A computer works at very high speed.</li>
                            <li>It can solve big calculations and process data in a seconds.</li>
                            <li>Example: If you give a long list of numbers to add, the computer will give the answer in less than a second.</li>
                        </ul></li>
                        <li><strong>Accuracy (सहीपन):</strong> 
                        <ul>
                            <li>Computers give correct results if we give correct instructions.</li>
                            <li>It does not make mistakes on its own.</li>
                            <li>Example: If a student types "2 + 3", the computer will always say "5".</li>
                        </ul></li>
                        <li><strong>Automation (स्वचालन):</strong> 
                         <ul>
                            <li>Computers can work automatically once we give them a command.</li>
                            <li>They don't need someone to keep telling them what to do every second.</li>
                            <li>Example: If you start a game, the computer will keep running it on its own.</li>
                        </ul></li>
                        <li><strong>Storage (सञ्चय क्षमता):</strong> 
                        <ul>
                            <li>A computer can store a huge amount of data (information).</li>
                            <li>You can save your school notes, pictures, music, and videos and use them anytime.</li>
                            <li>Example: Computers can store thousands of books in digital form.</li>
                        </ul></li>
                        <li><strong>Versatility (विविध काम गर्न सक्ने क्षमता):</strong> 
                        <ul>
                            <li>A computer is versatile because it can be used for many types of work in different places. It is not limited to just one job.</li>
                        </ul>    </li>
                        <li><strong>Diligence (नथाक्ने क्षमता):</strong> 
                            <ul>
                            <li>Unlike humans, a computer never gets tired or bored.</li>
                            <li>It can keep working all day and night without rest.</li>
                            <li>Example: A computer in a bank can work 24 hours without losing speed or focus.</li>
                        </ul></li>

                    <p>The working principle of a computer is based on the following four basic operations:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Input:</strong> The process of entering data and instructions into the computer.</li>
                        <li><strong>Processing:</strong> The computer processes the input data according to the instructions provided.</li>
                        <li><strong>Output:</strong> The result of the processed data is displayed or outputted to the user.</li>
                        <li><strong>Storage:</strong> The computer stores data and instructions for future use.</li>

                    <p><b>It can be explained as</b> <br> 
                        A computer works on the fundamental principle of the Input, Process, Output Cycle. First, it receives data and instruction through input devices like keyboard, mouse, etc. This data is then sent to the C.P.U. to process the data by performing calculations comparisons and logical operations based on given instructions. It uses memory (RAM) to temporarily store the data being used or processed once the processing is complete the result is sent to the output devices such as monitor, printer. Additionally, storage devices like harddisks, pendrives, are used to save data and programs for future use. This entire process happens very quickly, allowing the computers to perform task efficiently and accurately.
